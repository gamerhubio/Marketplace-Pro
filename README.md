# GamerHub

MultiChain Aggregator for Web2 and Web3 Games, Metaverses, and NFTs.

## Description

We are building a subscription-based aggregator that brings together games from both the web2 and web3 gaming industries.
Users can earn while playing games, creating content, performing tasks, and trading in-game assets and NFTs.
GamerHub also helps the transition of existing web2 games to web3 by implementing sustainable Play-To-Earn models.
